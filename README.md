## Migrate your community to Scroll and unlock a universe of efficiency.

MigratoOoR! is a tool that allows projects to migrate their token supply from Mainnet to Scroll, while offering incentives to long-time holders and early adopters through token rewards. With MigratoOoR!, projects can embrace Ethereum's rollup-centric scalability vision, utilizing Scroll's cost-efficient and high-performance infrastructure.

### Background

MigratoOoR! was developed as part of the ETHGlobal Bangkok 2024 Hackathon by **Team Migrator ETHBelgrade**. The project showcases the potential of Ethereum rollups and their alignment with Ethereumâ€™s rollup-centric roadmap. It was designed to tackle token migration challenges while leveraging cutting-edge L1 and L2 technologies, including Scroll and vlayer.

---

### Overview

MigratoOoR! simplifies the process of migrating a governance token from Ethereum L1 to Scroll L2 while maintaining Ethereum's robust security guarantees. It leverages Scroll's advanced technology to reduce costs and enable scalability.

Steps in the Migration:

1. Migration Proposal: Protocol operators deploy a new governance ERC20 token on Scroll L2 via the MigratoOoR! dashboard and configure the migration.
2. Migration Process: Users migrate their tokens from Ethereum L1 to Scroll L2 via a trustless bridge, locking tokens in the L1 contract and minting them in the L2.
3. Rewards Distribution: Protocol operators can distribute rewards to incentivize early migration and long-term token holding using the MigratoOoR! rewards system.
4. Hosting the canonical token supply on Scroll L2 brings significant transaction cost reductions and aligns projects with Ethereum's rollup roadmap.

### Key Features

#### The problem that MigratoOoR! solves

MigratoOoR! addresses several key challenges faced by projects that initially launched their tokens on Ethereum Layer 1 (L1):

1. High Transaction Costs on Ethereum L1 -> Lower Price Scroll L2 transactions.
2. Scalability Bottlenecks -> Alleviate network congestion by migrating dao related computation to Scroll L2.
3. Complex Token Migration -> Standard Token Migration Framework.
4. Limited Interoperability -> Use of Chainlink's CCIP CCT to make te new governance token in Scroll multichain.

Tokens deployed solely on Ethereum L1 are restricted in terms of multichain interoperability. Projects need solutions to enable cross-chain functionality while maintaining the token's core features and security.

### Technical details

To construct a trustless L1 -> L2 bridge for token migrations, MigratoOoR! leverages Scroll's new L1SLOAD precompile, which allows users to verify token locks in the L1 bridge contract.

In the rewards distribution system MigratoOoR! migrator uses Vlayer time travel feature to compute and verify in Scroll L2 the amount of rewards acquired by long therm holding the tokens.

To introduce multichain functionality for the new token on Scroll, protocol owners can opt to deploy it as a Chainlink Cross-Chain Token, unlocking enhanced interoperability across multiple chains.

### Notable Components

- **L1 and L2 Contracts**: Core smart contracts for bridging and migration.
- **Frontend**: React-based interface to interact with the bridge.
- **Vlayer Integration**: Off-chain reward calculation and verification tools.
